        <h1>Who is Brian Kernighan?</h1>
        <p>Brian Kernighan is influential in the world of computing. He Worked at Bell Labs for 30 years where he contributed to many projects; including the development of Unix, A Mathematical Programming Language (AMPL), The first documented “Hello World” program, and much more. Kernighan is the author of the book The C Programming Language with co-author Dennis Ritchie, Ritchie is the original language designer of C. His achievements are incredible and helped shaped the world of computing as we know it today.</p>

        <p>Kernighan is not as well known as a Steve Jobs or Bill Gates, but one can argue that his developments are just as important to computing as Gates and jobs. Operating systems like Windows, Mac OS, and Linux would probably be very different without taking inspiration from Unix. The programming languages that are popular today, especially C++, are derived from the work that went into developing and popularizing The C Programming language and the book by the same name. Today he goes by Professor Kernighan, he taught a CS 50 glass at Harvard and is now at Princeton which he graduated in 1969. </p>
