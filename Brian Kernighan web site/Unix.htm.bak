<H1>Who is Brian Kernighan?</H1>
<P>Brian Kernighan is influential in the world of computing. He Worked at Bell 
Labs for 30 years where he contributed to many projects; including the 
development of Unix, A Mathematical Programming Language (AMPL), The first 
documented “Hello World” program, and much more. Kernighan is the author of the 
book The C Programming Language with co-author Dennis Ritchie, Ritchie is the 
original language designer of C. His achievements are incredible and helped 
shaped the world of computing as we know it today.</P>
<P>Kernighan is not as well known as a Steve Jobs or Bill Gates, but one can 
argue that his developments are just as important to computing as Gates and 
jobs. Operating systems like Windows, Mac OS, and Linux would probably be very 
different without taking inspiration from Unix. The programming languages that 
are popular today, especially C++, are derived from the work that went into 
developing and popularizing The C Programming language and the book by the same 
name. Today he goes by Professor Kernighan, he taught a CS 50 glass at Harvard 
and is now at Princeton which he graduated in 1969. </P>
