        <h1>Kernighan and Bell Labs</h1>
        <p>Bell Labs is an industrial research and scientific development company that was part of AT&T until 1996. Kernighan was offered a permanent job after his summer internship at Bell Labs, he said after college he didn’t even interview at any other places since he was offered the position. AT&T was a regulated monopoly at the time and they provided funding for Bell Labs to do research on anything they wanted. That made it a very liberating place to work, there was no management telling anyone what to work on, freeing people to work on things that are long term under no pressure. Another person working at Bell Labs was Dennis Ritchie. Ritchie is well known for creating the C programming language and the Unix operating system. Kernighan and Ritchie developed a very close relationship while working at together. They worked on the Creation of the Unix operating system together and after the C programming language was created Kernighan and Ritchie wrote a book by the same name as the language. </p>
